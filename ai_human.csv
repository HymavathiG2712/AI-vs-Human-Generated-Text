"The Waco standoff in 1993 was a complex and controversial event that garnered significant attention and sparked various reactions among the American population. It is important to note that not all segments of the population rallied around the leader of the Branch Davidians, David Koresh, and his actions. However, there were certain factors that contributed to the support received by the group during that time. 1. Media Coverage: The media played a significant role in shaping public perception of the events in Waco.",1
"The identification of the ruins of Troy is based on a combination of archaeological evidence, historical accounts, and literary sources. The site of Troy, located in modern-day Turkey, was initially discovered by the German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann in the late 19th century. While Schliemann's excavation methods were not always scientifically rigorous, subsequent archaeological work has confirmed the existence of the ancient city. One of the key pieces of evidence is the stratigraphy of the site.",1
"""Sk8er Boi"" by Avril Lavigne, released in 2002, does touch upon some aspects of high school dynamics during that time period in North American city/suburban schools. While it is important to note that experiences varied across different schools and regions, the song does capture certain elements of the social pecking order. During the turn of the century, the social hierarchy in high schools often revolved around cliques and subcultures.",1
"The activities you are referring to were carried out by the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, commonly known as the Black Panthers. The organization was founded in 1966 by Huey P.

The Black Panthers' decision to openly carry firearms during their activities was twofold.",1
"The release of the JFK assassination files in October 2017 did not provide any groundbreaking revelations or drastically change our understanding of the event. However, it did shed some light on previously undisclosed information and added a few interesting details. Some of the notable findings include:1. Lee Harvey Oswald's trip to Mexico City: The files revealed that Oswald had visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico City just weeks before the assassination. This raised questions about his potential contacts with foreign intelligence agencies. 2.",1
"While it is true that Rebecca, a pet raccoon, was brought to the White House during Calvin Coolidge's presidency, there is no evidence to support the claim that the intention was to eat her at a Thanksgiving dinner. The story of Rebecca as a potential meal is often cited, but it lacks historical substantiation. As for the popularity of eating raccoons among high society in 1920s America, it is unlikely.",1
"The concept of legal adulthood and the age at which individuals are considered adults varies across different societies and has evolved over time. The age of 18 as the legal adult age is a modern convention that has been adopted by many countries. In the United States, for example, the legal adult age of 18 was established with the ratification of the 26th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1971.",1
"Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have not always been the only Abrahamic religions. In fact, there were several other Abrahamic religions that existed in the past but are no longer practiced today. These include:1. Samaritanism: Samaritans are a small ethno-religious group that follows a variant of ancient Israelite religion. They consider themselves descendants of the ancient Israelites and have their own version of the Torah. 2.",1
"In medieval times, going to the beach for recreational purposes was not a common activity for most people. The concept of leisure time and recreational activities, as we understand them today, was quite different in the medieval period. For the majority of the population, who were engaged in agricultural or other labor-intensive activities, leisure time was limited. The beach was generally seen as a place associated with work, particularly for those involved in fishing or maritime trade.",1
"As a well-to-do Roman aristocrat in the 2nd century, your reaction to your wife's interest in Christianity would depend on various factors such as your personal beliefs, social standing, and political affiliations. Christianity was a relatively new and rapidly growing religious movement during this period, originating from the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire. 1. Religious Tolerance: Roman society was generally tolerant of different religious practices, as long as they didn't challenge the authority of the state or disrupt social order.",1
"The concept of a ""sniper"" as we understand it today, referring to a highly skilled marksman who engages targets from a concealed position, did not exist in the same form before the invention of firearms. However, individuals throughout history have employed similar tactics to those used by modern snipers, using ranged weapons to target specific individuals or weaken enemy forces from a distance. Before firearms, archers or crossbowmen fulfilled a role somewhat similar to snipers.",1
"In the context of American popular culture in the early 1990s, it would be incorrect to say that the disdain for large female posteriors was a universal cultural norm. While there were certainly beauty standards that favored slimmer figures, it's important to note that beauty ideals have always varied across cultures and time periods. Different cultures and communities have different preferences when it comes to body shape and size.",1
"In 1850, traveling from London to British India would have been a long and arduous journey, but it was indeed possible for someone in your situation to make the trip. However, it's important to note that traveling to India would not guarantee adventure and fortune. It was a challenging and unfamiliar environment, and success was not guaranteed for everyone.",1
"The concept of the ""terrible twos"" and tantrums is not a modern phenomenon. Children in medieval times, like today, would also experience challenging behaviors during their early years. However, it is important to note that the understanding and interpretation of child development and behavior varied across different cultures and time periods. In medieval society, there was generally a greater emphasis on discipline and obedience compared to contemporary parenting styles. Parents might have employed stricter methods to ensure their children conformed to societal norms.",1
"In Ancient Rome, while slaves had the possibility of accumulating wealth and purchasing their freedom, their legal and social status remained subordinate to their masters. However, there were certain legal protections in place that discouraged masters from arbitrarily taking a slave's wealth. Legally, slaves were considered property, and their masters held significant power over them. However, Roman law recognized that slaves could possess personal property and engage in certain economic activities.",1
"The Soviet government's policy of providing government-paid vacations in sanatoriums was part of its broader effort to promote the well-being and productivity of its citizens. These sanatoriums functioned as health resorts that offered a range of medical treatments, recreational activities, and restorative therapies. The experience of staying in a Soviet sanatorium varied depending on the specific facility, location, and time period. Generally, the accommodations in sanatoriums were designed to be comfortable and provide a relaxing environment.",1
"Yes, throughout history, people have indeed been known to adulterate or cut spices with other substances to increase their weight and profitability. This practice was driven by the desire for economic gain and the high value placed on spices in various societies. During the Middle Ages and Renaissance, spices were highly sought after and often came from distant lands, making them expensive commodities. To maximize profits, some spice merchants would dilute or mix spices with cheaper substances, such as ground seeds, roots, or even dust.",1
"The decision of certain religious groups to maintain traditional dress rather than adopt contemporary fashion is often rooted in a combination of religious beliefs, historical factors, and cultural preservation. Let's take a look at two examples you mentioned: Hasidic Jews and the Pope. Hasidic Jews, a branch of Orthodox Judaism, adhere to a strict interpretation of religious laws and traditions.",1
"The lack of personal security for President Lincoln on the night of April 14, 1865, was indeed a notable aspect of his assassination. However, it is important to understand the context of the time and the circumstances surrounding the incident. During the American Civil War, personal security for the President of the United States was not as extensive as it is today.",1
"During the 1990s, both Mexican-American and African-American communities in the United States faced significant challenges and disparities in terms of quality of life. While it is important to note that experiences varied within and between communities, some general observations can be made. In predominantly African-American inner-city neighborhoods, many residents faced deeply entrenched issues such as poverty, high crime rates, inadequate housing, and limited access to quality education and healthcare.",1
"In the chaos of naval battles during the Age of Sail, when enemy ships sank next to each other, the actions of the surviving sailors largely depended on the specific circumstances and the individuals involved. While it is possible that some sailors may have continued fighting in the water, attempting to drown one another, this behavior was likely not the norm. In general, surviving sailors were more likely to prioritize their own survival and rescue over continuing hostilities.",1
"The sustained popularity of the name 'Michael' in the United States for several decades is indeed quite remarkable. While there isn't a single definitive explanation for its enduring appeal, there are a few theories that could shed some light on the phenomenon. One factor that contributed to the name's popularity was its strong religious connotations.",1
"While it is true that the United States has never had a female president, it is important to note that the advancement of women's rights and gender equality does not necessarily guarantee the presence of women in top political positions. The representation of women in leadership roles is influenced by numerous factors, including political, cultural, and historical contexts. In the case of the United States, the absence of a female president could be attributed to a variety of factors.",1

Incredible answer. This was very well sourced but also in a ELI5 style format. Love how succinct you were too and kept it all on track. Thank you!,0
"That is generally what ""foraging"" implies. It was standard practice for conventional armies throughout the world until the advent of canning and motorized transport made it possible for armies to carry their own food supplies. Prior to that, it was impossible for an army to carry all of its own food.A soldier can carry maybe a week's worth of rations at a time, and that is if you are ok with giving him a heavy load which will have a negative impact on his ability to fight. Any extra food has to be carried on wagons, which are pulled by horses or mules. Horses and mules need food too, in fact the food needed for livestock is far bulkier and heavier than the food needed for people, so then you need to carry more food in more wagons pulled by more horses/mules. You can see how the prospect of armies carrying their own food quickly spirals out of control.Foraging enables an army to minimize its supply train and therefore move much more quickly, however it also means the size of an army is limited by the ability of a given local area to supply it with food, and it also means that the army HAS to move regularly as it depletes local food supplies. Therefore a combination of supply trains carrying extra food and foraging has always been the solution used by armies to feed themselves with different amounts of emphasis on either side of this ""equation"" depending on circumstances and military doctrine. Generally ""people food"" would be carried in supply wagons, while fodder for livestock would ""foraged"" from local populations.Some sort of compensation was often offered to people by foraging soldiers in exchange for supplies, but there was no negotiation for price, the money offered rarely reflected market value for the goods taken, and often relatively worthless I.O.U's were given instead of cash. Then of course, it was also quite common for soldiers to simply take without asking at all.",0
"I find it difficult to impose any sort of rigid cartographic principles on most of these. For example, the Fra Mauro map seems to duplicate labels liberally to show extent. There are 2 labels for Europe and 3 for Asia. Not to mention 2 Egypts, 2 Mesopotamias, 2 Tartarias etc.For the Waldseem√ºller map, the principle seems to be finding empty space, so Europe has the smallest letters of all the major land-masses, and the most dispersed (I also can't find the 'EU'). But like with Asia, Africa has been set in an essentially empty section of the map. It also has the province of Africa and Libya... so I'm with you on the problem of how to interpret 'Libya Inferior'. It seems to denote an intermediate sized region along the lines of Ethiopia. But we find duplications in medieval mappaemundi as well. The Ebstorf Map, for example, has Africa written in large capitals across the landmass, but also has 'Africa' written in small caps under the 'A' of Africa, itself very near the above quotation of Isidore about the etymology of Africa. Now this doesn't obviously reference a province, since under 'Libia' there is another text explaining that the region there is either Zeugis or Africa (with another paraphrase of Isidore).",0
"I am not a historian, but I am a social scientist working in critical agrarian studies (an interdisciplinary field), so I can offer you some well-researched explanations on changes in agrarian social structures around the world and in the US that help answer your question. I am not able, however, to go equally in depth into elements pertaining to the specific history of US politics that make up another part of the answer to the question (eg repression of socialist movements and workers' rebellions along the twentieth century, changes in religion, etc.), which I'll only briefly allude to, so I hope others can complement on that.I assume from your question and the references to Eugene Debs and William Jenkings that you are asking about farmers supporting progressive politics in the United States, specifically in the 20th century, although you didn't specifically say so. I should state, however, for context, that the potential ""progressive"" political role of landowners and peasants is a classical question in social science - especially within the history of Marxism, where in more orthodox versions the working class is typically presented as the revolutionary class and the peasantry is considered either an outdated class (remnants of feudalism) or as having interests closer aligned with the bourgeoisie and with larger landowners (since they often also own or detain land, differently from those that only own their labor-force and thus ""have nothing to lose""). But there have also been varying streams within Marxism, especially in the 20th century, recognizing the peasantry as also being in conflict with capitalism, being constantly vulnerable to being dispossessed, indebted and also having their surplus labor robbed, and therefore often having a key historical role constructing radical politics around the world (eg authors Theodor Shanin, Eric Wolf, a large part of Latin-American Marxism, Maoism, etc.). Outside the US, the ""rural poor"" (a varied social segment, including peasants, rural workers, small farmers, indigenous peoples, among others) have often continued to have a more progressive role in politics, and a classical book on this is Eric Wolf's ""Peasant Wars of the Twentieth Century"".You can note that I was using the word ""peasant"", which is a word often used to describe small farmers in medieval Europe and also in the contemporary Global South. But this word has less typically been used in the context of the United States, which has its own history of colonial settlement, wider massacre and less miscigenation with indigenous peoples (compared to Latin America), strong imaginary of conquest of the ""frontier"", in which ""farmers"" have played a key role, and the influence of protestant ethics. This all has led us to associate ""farmers"" in the US, even before the twentieth century, with entrepreneurship, self-sacrifice, individual risk-taking and economic units centered around the family instead of the wider community, which are all elements that can often be swayed towards regressive politics instead of progressive politics, depending on the historical moment.When we talk of the history of the politics of ""farmers"" in the US - do we refer to the tobacco plantation owners in the eighteenth century?  To the small farmers escaping the Dust Bowl? To emancipated slaves trying to access land to cultivate? As you can surmise, the word ""farmer"" can mean many different things, in different historical contexts, with different implications of class, race, family formation and gender relations. In the case of the United States, agrarian structures have suffered incredibly drastic changes in the twentieth century due to economic concentration and technological change of capitalist agriculture, to the point where we can say now that most of the smaller or mid-size farmers - the ones you ascribe to supporting socialist politics in the beginning of the century - have simply been extinguished. Tony Weis points out the starking figure that, at the end of the twentieth century, there were more prison inmates in the United States than there are full-time farmers - that is, US full-time farmers now make up less than 1% of the population.He writes: ""A few snapshots of the US farm economy at the end of the twentieth century indicate the magnitude of this transformation: the area of cultivated land per agricultural worker in the US (58 hectares) is roughly fifty times the world average (Gilland 2002); farms greater than 500 acres (203 hectares) control 79 per cent of all US farmland; a mere 8 per cent of farms (with sales of at least US$250,000) account for 72 per cent of all farm sales along with the majority of farm subsidies; and the population calling farming their principal occupation was under 1 million, with the bulk of production coming from only about one-third of these (USCB 1999). There are more prisoners in the USA than full-time farmers. The flipside of the massive industrial operations that provide the bulk of production are the much smaller-scale family farms barely hanging on."" (Weis, 2007, p. 83).Throughout the twentieth century, in the US and in many other countries, agriculture and livestock raising became much more technified and industrial, with use of Green Revolution technologies (and later biotechnologies), requiring farmers to have more and more capital each season merely to get by in increasingly competitive industries. Besides the competition among them and the transformation of ""family farmers"", the food commodity chains as a whole became increasingly corporate-owned and oligopolized, from the industry of inputs and machinery, to trading, transport and retail, strangling smaller farmers from all sides of the value chain. Food production also became concentrated in a few key commodities, used as flexible ingredients for a variety of processed foods (as well as fuel, industrial use, etc): corn, wheat, soybean, and animal meat (which exploded in the past decades and required more and more grain and oilseeds for animal feed), and there was an increased division of labor and global trade of food, with much of American produce becoming imported from abroad.Of course, there has also been resistance to this and even efforts of small farmer revival, as can be seen today in the proliferation of farmers' markets, Community-Supported Agriculture, urban gardens, etc. The National Family Farm Coalition is an example of ongoing farmer association with progressive politics, which mobilizes ""family farmers, fishers, and ranchers for fair prices, vibrant communities, and healthy foods free of corporate domination"" (their website). We can also look at more recent efforts to mobilize migrant farm workers, which in many senses might be closer in class interests to small farmers at the beginning of the twentieth century than some of the large soy producers now (even if they can also be strangled by the transnational agribusiness corps and trade and taxation policy).Concurrent to those economic changes, authors have recently called attention that regressive politics - or right-wing populism - was already spreading among farmers since the 1930s and especially since the second half of the twentieth century, often in a coordinated reaction to the labor and socialist movements that had previously gained force. Montenegro de Wit et al. (2019) contrast the historical spread of regressive populism in California and in the Midwest. California agriculture in a sense was already born more ""capitalist"" and developed later in US history, so emerging larger farmers could more easily use authoritarian populist tactics against organized farm labor and otherized migrant and racialized minorities. In the Midwest, meanwhile, farmers had historically been more disenfranchised and politics fractured more across class lines. There too, however, there were significant backlashes since the 1940s, with the economic context described above of consolidation of larger agribusiness, as well as Cold War-style repression of labor and left-wing movements. The authors point out that, even in the 1980s, however, the Midwest saw the rise of new left-wing and more radical farmer movements in reaction to falling prices - although a part of them also adopted racist discourse (we should note that, historically, there have been often awkward connections between defending disenfranchised and impoverished communities while still otherizing internal or external racial minorities, which some might see as simultaneously ""progressive"" and ""regressive"" movements, depending on how you classify these terms).(continuation and sources in comment below)",0
"The Spanish Influenza was honestly an utterly fascinating pandemic, in part because it was one of the best-documented pandemics of the early 20th century. The 1918 Influenza, better known in America as the Spanish Influenza, changed the landscape of the western world. However, this response shall focus mainly on the effects it had on America to limit the scope of the answer. Answer why the 1918 Flu stopped spreading, it must be broken down into three parts: what it was, why it spread, and how it died out.So, what was the 1918 Flu? In short, it is a highly contagious viral mutation of the illness best known as the flu. Infecting between 3-11% of Americans every year, it usually is not very deadly, primarily killing the elderly, the very young, or anyone else with a comprised immune system. The virus, which mutates and changes often, has various strains with varying levels of severity, in part because it often hops between species. The 1918 influenza was remarkable because of how deadly it was and how quickly it spread. The most popular theory right now is it was an avian virus that mutated to infect swine, and then onto humans (Nelson, Worobey 2018, p. 2498). Of course, this is not definitive due to the difficulty in studying such an infectious disease, especially considering the limited number of viable samples. However, assuming this is true, it can begin to explain why it had a higher mortality rate than most recorded influenza strains. There were other factors at play as well, which also merits consideration.From 1914 to 1918, the first world war ravaged the western world, causing around 40 million casualties (Encyclopedia Britannica, 2020). While movies portray the World Wars as glorious and bloody, with young men dying bravely for king and country, the fact is disease killed more people than the fighting ever did (Diseases in World War I - World War I Centennial, n.d.). Soldiers lived in squalid conditions, that are frankly unimaginable to the modern American. Dead bodies left to rot and fester where they lay, near the trenches that so many soldiers spent months in, knee-deep in mud, little food, and very tight quarters; it was a petri dish of disease and death.Of course, military hospitals and training camps were barely better. After all, not even a century beforehand, doctors had barely considered handwashing, and it took decades before it caught on in the greater medical community (Geneva: World Health Organization, 2009). It should be no surprise then that the first recorded case of the 1918 influenza case was in an American military base in Kansas (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018). The first wave of the disease was in the spring of 1918, where over the next six months, it spread in small bursts.However, the virus changed around the fall of 1918 when the disease suddenly became markedly more infectious and deadly. As noted above, influenza viruses are volatile, mutating frequently, which is why there is a new vaccine every year. The virus likely would not have been half as deadly, had it not been for the war. People who would ordinarily never travel farther than a few towns away from where they were born were suddenly going to countries they would otherwise never have seen, the virus their invisible passenger. October alone saw almost 200,000 Americans dead, terrifyingly high number. Nurse and doctors were falling like flies; fighting was slowing down in Europe, partly because the soldiers there were too sick or dead to fight  (Holmes), and it was getting harder and harder to get new soldiers out on the battlefield- they kept dying in transit. November saw the end of the bloodiest war the world had seen at that point because there were not enough men healthy enough left to fight.So the Spanish Influenza reigned for the next year or so, leaving piles of bodies in its wake.  With our background in hand, now the question at hand can be answered: why exactly did the 1918 pandemic fizzle out? Well, there are three main reasons. First, the end of the first world war had a significant impact on restricting the spread of the disease and freeing up the doctors and nurses who had been serving on the front lines. While it would be easy to assume that the Americans returning home after the armistice would infect those around them, soldiers often remained in military care until recovered from the flu, partly because those afflicted were usually too sick to transport.Secondly, public health education programs were profoundly effective, in combination with new laws. Many of the hygienic habits we have today stem from work during the pandemic to promote personal sanitation (Marisam, 2007, p. 279.2).  The National Institue of Health, or NIH (which was founded to fight the 1918 Flu), promoted, along with local efforts, things like handwashing, wearing masks, social distancing, and not spitting in public. There is a heap of pictures from the period that show the posters, signs, and flyers that tell citizens to practice what is now basic hygiene (\[\[Collection of photos from 1918\]\], 1918).Finally, the biggest reason the pandemic died out was that the virus mutated. While it is easy to assume the deadlier the virus, the better it is doing for itself, which simply isn't true. However, if a virus kills all of its hosts, then it no longer has any viable hosts. Instead, the most successive virus is the one that can chill in a host long enough to spread. There is also the fact that virus mutation is luck of the draw. Sometimes the mutation is efficient for survival, and other times not so much, just like humans are sometimes born with harmful genetic mutations. It also be noted while the exact strain which killed so many during the fall 1918, the flu, and even H1N1 are rarely fully eradicated. TheNthMan did a really good job of explaining the actual science behind it, so go read his answer. My response, however, really focuses on the historical part of it. &#x200B;So, in TL;DR? It burned itself out too fast, and when it mutated, it could not survive against the public health measures people had taken.

I hope y'all are doing all right and staying safe <3&#x200B;&#x200B;\-The world's most annoying yet boring pre-med student with an obsession with epidemiology.&#x200B;EDIT: Just wanted to make a note explaining why I answered the way I did. I admit most of my response doesn't answer the question directly, I was trying to write this in such a way that if all you knew nothing at all about the topic, you could still follow along. If anyone would like a more detailed answer, particularly on the science of it, or at least, what the popular theories currently are, I would be happy to.

"Please indulge me, in my tryptophan-induced daze, as I very briefly review the essentials of Roman nomenclature. During the late Republic and early Empire, male Roman citizens typically (but by no means always) had three names - a praenomen (personal name), nomen (clan name), and cognomen (family name). So in the name Gaius Julius Caesar, Gaius is the praenomen, Julius the nomen, and Caesar the cognomen. Roman women in the same period generally had to make do with a single name, the feminine form of their father's nomen. Thus, Gaius Julius Caesar's daughter was named Julia, as was every other female representative of the Julian clan. Whence this interesting question.Publicly, women were often distinguished by the names of their fathers or husbands. If a certain Julia, for example, was married to a member of the Metellus family, she might be known as Julia Metelli (Metellus' Julia). Alternatively, she might be differentiated from her younger sister by being called Julia Maior (Julia the elder) or Julia Prima (First Julia). Her sister, accordingly, would be Julia Minor (Julia the younger) or Julia Secunda (Julia no. 2).But those conventions were designed for public contexts. In private, closely-related women with the same name probably referred to one another by nicknames. On the basis of our sparse evidence, affectionate terms like Livilla (Lil' Livia) or Julitta (Little Julia) seem to have been common. Family members might call a beautiful girl or woman ""Venus"" (e.g. Sen., Apocl. 8), or a musically-talented lady ""Musa"" (muse). Other nicknames, we may safely assume, were equally descriptive and less flattering. Relatives who did not know each other well may have sidestepped the whole name issue by referring to one another as ""sister"" or ""dearest soul,"" as in the famous letter of Claudia Severa from the Roman fort at Vindolanda.",0

"The contradictions in mid-20th Century American culture fascinate me. This is not even ten years after WWII, during which American soldiers were notorious for enthusiastically patronizing the prostitutes of whatever land they happened to be in. The demand in wartime Hawaii was so heavy that johns were limited to a few minutes with prostitutes, and the prostitutes, who had been imported from the mainland en masse, could essentially charge whatever they or the brothel owner chose. Do you have any thoughts on this? Can the 1950s can be seen as a reaction to the looseness of wartime morals?",0
"Obviously, the answer to this question is no from a legal perspective. Bush was legally the winner of the 2000 election, and he attained the presidency by victory in the electoral college as required by the Constitution. However, one could argue, and I am trying to choose my words very carefully, that Bush's election was a failure of democracy as it appears he should not have won.So, the big deal is the Bush v Gore case and specifically the presidential vote in Florida. So, if you understand the way American presidential elections work, then you already know you need to receive the majority of electoral college votes to win. Not many foreigners understand that each state decides how these electors are distributed, but most of them, Florida included, awards all of its electoral college votes to whichever candidate has the simple ~~majority~~ plurality. In the 2000 election, Florida's 29 electoral college votes were enough to give either candidate the win as the other states were tied. The first official tally of the votes was called as a victory for George W. Bush. Also, the difference in votes in Florida was less than 1% that year. Florida has an election law that automatically recounts when the difference is less than 1% which was triggered in this case. Now, most of the dispute came over these recounts.So, Florida at the time used a punch card system for voting which has since been replaced. One of the reasons is that there was a chance (I will simplify) of hardware failure that could make a vote uncountable by the machine reader, and since the final vote difference between each candidate was actually less than 0.1%, the hardware failure rate could actually change the result. Specifically, since the problem seemed to have to do with how hard you punched the card making unclear marks on the ballot, and it was postulated this could affect senior populations very much which are a large part of the Florida constituency. So, the Gore campaign specifically filed for hand recounts of the ballots in specific counties (those favorable to him) at the Florida Supreme Court because a human could more accurately count ballots because of the hardware failure issue though some saw this as a political ploy to try and magic more votes since his supporters may be inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt on unclear ballots. Still, the Florida Supreme Court ruled in favor of Gore and ordered the recount including the counts by hand as requested in accordance with Florida statutes. Now, another part of this is that the Florida Law for recounts also has a time limit to produce those results before electors are decided upon. So, Florida polling stations only had a limited time to perform this recount, but it got underway.Now, Bush not wanting to have his initial victory overturned sued in the Federal Supreme Court in the case Bush v. Gore. His argument was generally that because each polling location was counting votes based on different criteria (which was true, each polling place was just trying to do their best on a short schedule) that this violated the   Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution.  Basically, treating and counting different peoples votes under different criteria was unconstitutional and the supreme court agreed. The federal supreme court ordered the recount to stop, and, most importantly, there was now no more time left under Florida Law for a recount before that elector designation as I mentioned earlier. So, the clock just ran out, and the initial call for Bush was upheld. Now, this meant that the election really fell apart because of the Florida Division of Elections not producing an effective, fair, uniform criteria for the recount which the Supreme Court ruled could have been done legally. If they had, the recount might not have been stopped, and if there wasn't a time limit, the Division of Elections could have created criteria and had a full recount, but the law was what the law was.Now after all that was over. Several groups were able to study the ballots and do a review of the recounts based on specific criteria the state could have utilized for these ballots. The results were mixed in that different criteria produced different results for either Bush or Gore which gives some validity to the federal Supreme Court Arguments. However, one of the most comprehensive studies was the Florida Ballots Project which compared a great many ballots from the entire state that were both considered illegible for counting as well as some that were recounted which accounted for about 3% of the total vote. Their findings were pretty damning in that their review from almost every criteria would have given Gore the election had these ballots not been considered invalid due to those hardware failures I mentioned earlier.TL;DR - Bush won legally, but Gore lost because of voting machine errors and the fact that Florida had a time limit on recounts and failed to establish statewide uniform criteria for hand recounts.&#x200B;Edit: just a quick thank you for the gold",0
"I guess we should clarify what ""the general person"" is. European, Middle Eastern, Chinese, or African? Educated or uneducated? Upper class or lower? All of these have some bearing on the answer, and most of us will only be capable of discussing some. My own work is on the European middle ages, so that's what I'm going to be discussing here. (I think that this is doubly appropriate because I suspect that this post is a response to another post about William Manchester's (contemptible) A World Lit Only by Fire.) I hope to show, briefly, that not only were people aware of days, months, and years, but that they were deeply in tune with the rhythms of time. So the day part is pretty easy to address, and I'll start with it. For medievals, whether aristocratic or peasant or burgher, clerical or lay, Sunday was impossible to miss. Work was forbidden, plus there was obviously Mass, and so you'd be hard-pressed to find a person unaware of the day. This speaks to a point that I hope will be clear from this post: Time was governed by the sacred. What about the other days of the week? Here, again, let's look at religious services. The Divine Office, or Liturgy of the Hours( prayers like Lauds and Vespers), differed by the day, and so anyone praying the Hours would necessarily know what day of the week it was. Okay, so that's monks and priests, but what about laity? Well, in the later middle ages, we start seeing private devotional books of the Hours made for (wealthy, and usually female) laypersons. That's not to say that the Divine Office and the Mass were the only ways to know what day it was, but they should demonstrate the point, I think.Talking about medievals not knowing the month is a little peculiar to me because the idea that we somehow know the seasons better than people who lived and died by agriculture is, I mean, it's just not tenable. Uneducated people still understood seasons. Educated people, of course, also understood seasons. There's this fascinatingly complex methodology of medieval computus, the rationale of figuring out when Easter would be based on the lunar cycle. In a world where you couldn't Google when the full moon would be, the mechanisms for working it out were really arcane and complicated and should really dissuade us from thinking that nobody knew the cycle within the year. Also, we should consider the very old chant for the moveable feasts from Epiphany - in January each year, a priest (or deacon) would literally announce to the congregation when feasts would fall during the upcoming year, what day and month. So, I mean, that presumes an awareness of what days and months are.I suppose that years are a little harder for me to talk about, because so much medieval time is sacred and cyclical and the procession of years doesn't fit quite as easily into that. However, there was the whole millenarian thing, where a bunch of people thought that the world would end in the year 1,000, and then again in 1,033. Jay Rubenstein cites this as a major contributing factor to the pogroms, and then eventually the First Crusade. It was a really widespread belief. So I mean we can also look at chronicles and annals that say ""In this year, this happened,"" but if you want to really see ""average folk"" getting worked up over what year it was, look at millenarianism.Obviously, I'm coming at this from the perspective of medieval religious culture, because it's what I know. I hope that this has helped to prove that no, people didn't go around blithely unaware of what day or year it was. I also realize that it's fairly surface-level, and I'll be happy to go more in-depth if I wasn't clear about something. Assuming anyone even reads this.For a bit of further reading, I would suggestMargot Fassler, ""The Liturgical Framework of Time and the Representation of History,"" in Representing History, 900-1300: Art, Music, History, ed.

"The appearance of epidemics in early Islamic history may be attributed in part to the cyclical recurrences of plague in the Middle East following the Plague of Justinian, beginning in A. D. 541.  (Plague in Early Islamic History by Michael W. Dols, 1974)This is in addition to the well documented influence of the bubonic plague and the less ubiquitous Bombay plague. The above link describes historians' ability to recreate (to some extent) the epidemiological history of plagues in the Umaiyad period.The presence of these plagues prompted medical, religious, and legal explanations and instructions. These were instructions for citizens of nations as much as they were religious doctrine for adherents of faiths.The study goes on to propose that plague was a large factor in why the center of political power shifted from the Byzantine empire under Justinian to more northern European regions. According to the author, this is due to northern Europeans being relatively unaffected by the pervasive diseases of the time.So, to answer your question, plague control tactics were absolutely in place. These tactics came from many sources, not just religious ones. Finally, if the author was correct, plague control tactics of the time were not enough to protect Middle Eastern populations from the extent of damage that disease would go on to inflict, partially contributing to the destabilization of the region. Arabs (and by extension, many Muslims) were able to resist some of the effects of disease due to their nomadic and semi-nomadic way of life adjacent to the empire.",0
"Do you have any familiarity with Mayan names? I ask because translations of Mayan seem to switch back and forth from using names to literal translations and also sometimes mix the translated birth date with the untranslated name to form a single word for a name but will also use the birth date with the translated name in other cases (ie. Xibalba, Baby Jaguar, 1-Huanupe and 7-death are all proper names).",0

"But the strange thing in this case is that people generally accepted it was an accident despite obvious problems with the story. Here's the most detailed account from William of Malmesbury: Does this actually show anything at all about what people actually thought happened, though, given extreme unpopularity of William II (especially in literate religious circles whose records survive) and the seemingly enormous incentive to not attract the ire of the new king?  I don't know, but it does seem like if anyone did honestly think it was an assassination, they would have had a lot of reasons to not put that in writing.",0
"Some styles were cyclical - beards, for example, oscillated in length and cut - but they do not seem to have done so from any conscious or nostalgic attempt to recall a past time, save insofar as they were inspired by emperors who modeled their look on a famous predecessor.While I generally agree that we can't impose the idea of ""decade fashion"" onto the Roman world, I do think you are somewhat understating the ideological component to the styles of portraiture. Galba's portraiture hearkening back to the old, wrinkly, weather beaten styles of the Republic after the almost Alexandrian portraiture of Nero matches the general messaging of his rule, and it is not hard to draw similar contrasts between Trajan's dorky, close cropped hair cut and clean shaven face and Hadrian's distinctly Hellenistic styling.Obviously these are statues, not clothes, but that is more or less our source for Roman fashion, but more to the point they show that Romans were not unaware of the connection between appearance and messaging. Marcus Aurelius having his statues show the unkempt style of Hellenistic philosophers is not quite the same thing as a high school kid wearing bell bottoms to show they like The Beatles, but there is still intentionality and meaning to it.",0
